    ## Pre-upgrade Checks

    Before proceeding with the upgrade, verify your current node status:

    ```bash
    curl localhost:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'
    ```

    Ensure your node is fully synced before proceeding with the upgrade.

    ## Backup Process

    Create backups of your critical configuration files:

    ```bash
    cp .env .env.backup
    cp jwt.txt jwt.txt.backup
    ```

    ## Upgrade Steps

    1. Stop your current node:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

    2. Update the repository:

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git pull
    ```

    3. Update your `.env` file with the new image versions:

    ```bash
    # Update these specific lines in your .env file
    GETH_IMAGE=us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:v1.101411.1
    NODE_IMAGE=us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:v1.11.1
    ```

    4. Clean the Docker environment:

    ```bash
    docker compose down -v
    docker system prune -f
    ```

    5. Pull the new images:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

    6. Start the upgraded node:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    ## Pre-upgrade Requirements

    The AltLayer upgrade process requires a clean installation in a new directory. This method ensures a fresh start with the latest configurations.

    ## Upgrade Steps

    1. Create a new directory for the upgraded node:

    ```bash
    mkdir swell-node-v1.11.1
    cd swell-node-v1.11.1
    ```

    2. Clone the AltLayer repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alt-research/opstack-node-v1.11.1.git .
    ```

    3. Copy your existing configuration:

    ```bash
    cp ../your-old-node-directory/.env .
    cp ../your-old-node-directory/jwt.txt .
    ```

    4. Update the environment variables:

    ```bash
    # Update or verify these values in your .env file
    GETH_IMAGE=us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:v1.101411.1
    NODE_IMAGE=us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:v1.11.1
    L2_RPC=http://localhost:8545
    P2P_LISTEN_IP=0.0.0.0
    ```

    5. Stop the old node:

    ```bash
    cd ../your-old-node-directory
    docker compose down
    ```

    6. Start the new node:

    ```bash
    cd ../swell-node-v1.11.1
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Post-upgrade Verification

After the upgrade, verify your node is operating correctly:

1. Check the node sync status:

```bash
curl localhost:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'
```

2. Monitor the logs for any errors:

```bash
docker compose logs -f node
docker compose logs -f geth
```

3. Verify the current block height:

```bash
curl localhost:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the upgrade:

1. Check the node logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file
3. Ensure sufficient disk space is available
4. Confirm network connectivity to L1 endpoints

If problems persist, revert to the backup configuration:

```bash
# For Standard Upgrade
cp .env.backup .env
cp jwt.txt.backup jwt.txt
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# For AltLayer Upgrade
cd ../your-old-node-directory
docker compose up -d
```

The node upgrade process typically takes 10-15 minutes to complete. Monitor the logs to ensure proper synchronization after the upgrade.
