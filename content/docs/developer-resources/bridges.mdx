    Use the Swell Bridge to bridge assets between Ethereum and Swellchain
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Bridging Assets

The Standard Bridge contract enables asset transfers between Ethereum and Swellchain through a lock-and-mint mechanism. 
Please refer to the [Contract Addresses](/docs/developer-resources/contract-addresses) page for the addresses of the bridge and token contracts.

<Callout type="warn">
Please note that these addresses are subject to change. Always verify contract addresses through official sources before interacting with them.
</Callout>


To bridge assets, call the `bridgeERC20To()` function on the bridge contract with the following parameters: 
<TypeTable
  type={{
    sourceToken: {
      description: 'The address of the token to bridge on the source chain',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    },
    destinationToken: {
      description: 'The address of the token to mint on the destination chain',
      type: 'address', 
      default: '-'
    },
    recipient: {
      description: 'The address to receive the bridged tokens',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    },
    amount: {
      description: 'The amount of tokens to bridge',
      type: 'uint256',
      default: '-'
    },
    gasLimit: {
      description: 'Minimum gas limit for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'uint256',
      default: '-'
    },
    extraData: {
      description: 'Optional additional data for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'bytes',
      default: '0x'
    }
  }}
/>

### Bridging ETH

To bridge ETH between Ethereum and Swellchain, call the `bridgeETH()` or `bridgeETHTo()` functions on the bridge contract:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    recipient: {
      description: 'The address to receive the bridged ETH (only for bridgeETHTo)',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    },
    gasLimit: {
      description: 'Minimum gas limit for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'uint256',
      default: '-'
    },
    extraData: {
      description: 'Optional additional data for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'bytes',
      default: '0x'
    }
  }}
/>

<Callout type="info">
You can also bridge by sending a basic ETH transfer from an EOA directly to the Bridge Contract address.
This is possible because the Bridge Contract includes a receive function that enables direct ETH transfers from an EOA on Ethereum to Swellchain without calling specific bridge functions.
Find the contract addresses for mainnet and testnet in the [Contract Addresses](/docs/developer-resources/contract-addresses) section.
</Callout>



### Bridge Mechanics

The bridge locks the tokens on the source chain and mints equivalent tokens on the destination chain. 
Transfers from Ethereum to Swellchain complete in 1-3 minutes, while transfers back to Ethereum have a 7-day challenge period.


For more information on bridging assets via the Standard Bridge Contract, refer to the [Standard Bridge documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge).
