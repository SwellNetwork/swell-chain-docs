# Deploying and Using SuperchainERC20 on Swellchain

SuperchainERC20 provides a standardized token implementation enabling seamless asset movement across the Optimism Superchain ecosystem. This guide explains the standard's architecture, deployment process, and integration patterns for Swellchain developers.

## What is SuperchainERC20?

SuperchainERC20 extends the standard ERC20 token with cross-chain mint and burn capabilities, enabling seamless interoperability across the Superchain ecosystem. This token standard implements the ERC-7802 interface, providing deterministic cross-chain functionality with minimal latency between transfers.

The standard leverages a burn-and-mint mechanism that maintains a consistent token supply across all chains in the Superchain network:

- When tokens move between chains, they're burned on the source chain
- An equivalent amount is minted on the destination chain
- This process eliminates the need for liquidity pools or wrapped tokens

## Why SuperchainERC20 Matters for Swellchain

Integrating SuperchainERC20 provides Swellchain with essential cross-chain capabilities that enhance the network's interoperability within the broader Superchain ecosystem. The implementation enables you to deploy tokens that function seamlessly across multiple L2 networks with one-block latency for cross-chain transfers.

SuperchainERC20 integration creates opportunities for:

- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Unified token representation across chains improves capital efficiency
- **Simplified Developer Experience**: Consistent API for projects building on Swellchain
- **Reduced Fragmentation**: Improved capital efficiency for DeFi applications across the Superchain ecosystem - one chain to rule them all

## Deploying SuperchainERC20 - Quick Start

This guide provides a streamlined approach to deploying SuperchainERC20 tokens on Swellchain

### Prerequisites

- Foundry toolchain
- Node.js and pnpm
- Wallet with funds on Swellchain

Install Foundry toolchain:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Setup and Deployment

1. Clone the starter kit repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter.git
cd superchainerc20-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

3. Initialize environment files:

```bash
pnpm init:env
```

4. Configure deployment parameters in `deploy-config.toml`:

```toml
[deploy-config]
salt = "your-unique-salt"  # Used for deterministic deployment
chains = ["swell_chain", "op_chain_a"]  # List of target chains

[token]
owner_address = "0xYourWalletAddress"  # Token owner address
name = "YourTokenName"  # Token name
symbol = "YTK"  # Token symbol
decimals = 18  # Token decimals
```

5. Update RPC endpoints:

```bash
pnpm contracts:update:rpcs
```

6. Deploy your token:

```bash
pnpm contracts:deploy:token
```

This deployment process uses `Create2` to ensure your token deploys to the same address across all specified chains, a critical requirement for cross-chain functionality.

<Callout type="info">
Verify that your token is deployed at the same address on all target chains by checking each chain's block explorer with the contract address.
</Callout>

## Technical Architecture

### Cross-chain Message Flow

SuperchainERC20 transfers operate through a two-transaction message flow:

1. **Initiate Transaction**: On the source chain, tokens are burned and a cross-chain message is emitted
2. **Execute Transaction**: The message is relayed to the destination chain, triggering token minting

This flow ensures tokens maintain consistent total supply across the entire Superchain ecosystem.

### Interoperability Components

The Superchain interoperability system consists of three key components:

- **Message Passing Protocol**: Handles cross-chain inbox/outbox communication
- **OP Supervisor**: Provides visibility into cross-chain messages and monitors block status
- **Fault Proof System**: Shared across the interop cluster to ensure security

The system operates as a mesh network where each chain maintains connections with all other chains in the dependency set.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    crosschainMint: {
      description: 'Mints tokens from a source chain to the recipient',
      type: 'function',
      default: '-'
    },
    crosschainBurn: {
      description: 'Burns tokens when moving to a destination chain',
      type: 'function',
      default: '-'
    },
    SuperchainBridge: {
      description: 'Contract that orchestrates cross-chain transfers',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    }
  }}
/>

### Auto-relaying and Finality

The OP Supervisor service monitors block status and automatically relays cross-chain messages, enabling:

- One-block latency for cross-chain transfers
- Reorg awareness to prevent double-spend attacks
- Automatic reversion of transactions if source chain reorganizes

These capabilities allow for high-speed cross-chain composition while maintaining security guarantees.

## Security Considerations

For production deployments, ensure that:

1. Only the SuperchainERC20Bridge contract has permission to call `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` functions
2. The same salt value is used across all deployments to maintain address consistency
3. Token supply is properly managed across chains to prevent inflation

<Tabs items={['Correct Implementation', 'Vulnerable Implementation']}>
<Tab value="Correct Implementation">
```solidity
// Only the bridge can call crosschainMint and crosschainBurn
function crosschainMint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(superchainBridge), "Not bridge");
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Vulnerable Implementation">
```solidity
// VULNERABLE: Anyone can mint tokens
function crosschainMint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, verify your token functions correctly:

1. Start the local development environment:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Use the Superchain Dev Console to mint tokens and test transfers between chains.

Verify that tokens are correctly burned on the source chain and minted on the destination chain with consistent total supply.

## Advanced Integration

For projects requiring custom token behavior while maintaining cross-chain compatibility, consider:

- Extending the base SuperchainERC20 contract with additional functionality
- Implementing specific business logic through the owner interface
- Adding governance controls for managing permissions and parameters

### Converting Existing ERC20 Tokens

For projects with existing ERC20 tokens, migration to SuperchainERC20 requires:

1. Creating a new SuperchainERC20 implementation
2. Deploying it deterministically across all target chains
3. Setting up a migration mechanism for existing token holders
4. Configuring cross-chain permissions correctly

This process preserves token economics while enabling cross-chain functionality.
