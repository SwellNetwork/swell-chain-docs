</Callout>


Welcome to the SuperchainERC20 quickstart guide! In this guide, we'll cover how the token works and deployment process. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide has got you covered.


## What is SuperchainERC20?

SuperchainERC20 provides a standardized token implementation enabling seamless token transfers across the Superchain. 

SuperchainERC20 extends the standard ERC-20 token with cross-chain mint and burn capabilities, enabling seamless interoperability across the [Superchain interop cluster](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/explainer#superchain-interop-cluster). This token standard implements the [ERC-7802](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7802) interface to enable 1-block latency cross-chain mint/burn functionality.

## How does SuperchainERC20 work?

[SuperchainERC20](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainERC20.sol) and [SuperchainTokenBridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) work together to allow ERC-20 tokens to be transferred from one chain to the other.

SuperchainERC20 cross-chain transfers require two transactions:

1. **Initiate Transaction**: On the source chain, tokens are burned and a cross-chain message is emitted
2. **Execute Transaction**: The message is relayed to the destination chain, triggering token minting

This flow ensures tokens maintain consistent total supply across the entire Superchain ecosystem and eliminates the need for liquidity pools or wrapped tokens. 

## Why SuperchainERC20 matters for users, token issuers, and apps on Swellchain

Superchain interop provides Swellchain with essential cross-chain capabilities that enhance the network's interoperability. When token issuers use SuperchainERC20 over a typical ER-C20 deployment it gives token issuers access to the broader Superchain network effects, ensuring your tokens can seamlessly be used by apps and users across the Superchain. 

SuperchainERC20 deployment creates opportunities for:

- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Unified token representation across chains improves capital efficiency
- **Simplified Developer Experience**: Consistent API for projects building on Swellchain
- **Reduced Fragmentation**: Improved capital efficiency for DeFi applications across the Superchain ecosystem - one chain to rule them all

## Deploying SuperchainERC20 - Quickstart

This guide provides a streamlined approach to deploying SuperchainERC20 tokens on Swellchain

### Prerequisites

- Foundry toolchain
- Node.js and pnpm
- Wallet with funds on Swellchain

Install Foundry toolchain:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Setup and Deployment

1. Clone the starter kit repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter.git
cd superchainerc20-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

3. Initialize environment files:

```bash
pnpm init:env
```

4. Configure deployment parameters in `deploy-config.toml`:

<Callout type="info">
The `chains` field accepts a list of chain identifiers.
You can find more here in the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json).
</Callout>

```toml
[deploy-config]
salt = "your-unique-salt"  # Used for deterministic deployment
chains = ["mainnet/swell", "mainnet/op"]  # List of target chains

[token]
owner_address = "0xYourWalletAddress"  # Token owner address
name = "YourTokenName"  # Token name
symbol = "YTK"  # Token symbol
decimals = 18  # Token decimals
```

5. Update RPC endpoints:

```bash
pnpm contracts:update:rpcs
```

6. Deploy your token:

```bash
pnpm contracts:deploy:token
```

This deployment process uses `Create2` to ensure your token deploys to the same address across all specified chains, a critical requirement for cross-chain functionality.

<Callout type="info">
Verify that your token is deployed at the same address on all target chains by checking each chain's block explorer with the contract address.
</Callout>


## Security Considerations

<Callout type="info">
To ensure security, you must either design the deployer to allow only a specific trusted ERC-20 contract, such as SuperchainERC20, to be deployed through it, or call CREATE2 to deploy the contract directly from an EOA you control.

This precaution is critical because if an unauthorized ERC-20 contract is deployed at the same address on any Superchain network, it could allow malicious actors to mint unlimited tokens and bridge them to the network where the original ERC-20 contract resides.
</Callout>

For production deployments, ensure that:

1. Grant permissions to the `SuperchainTokenBridge`(address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000028`) to call `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`.
2. The same salt value is used across all deployments to maintain address consistency. If you do not deploy the contract to a specific destination chain, users will be unable to successfully move their tokens to that chain.
3. Token supply is properly managed across chains to prevent inflation

<Tabs items={['Correct Implementation', 'Vulnerable Implementation']}>
<Tab value="Correct Implementation">
```solidity
// Only the bridge can call crosschainMint and crosschainBurn
function crosschainMint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(Predeploys.SUPERCHAIN_TOKEN_BRIDGE), "Not bridge");
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Vulnerable Implementation">
```solidity
// VULNERABLE: Anyone can mint tokens
function crosschainMint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, verify your token functions correctly:

1. Start the local development environment:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Use the Superchain Dev Console to mint tokens and test transfers between chains.

Verify that tokens are correctly burned on the source chain and minted on the destination chain with consistent total supply.

## Advanced Integration

For projects requiring custom token behavior while maintaining cross-chain compatibility, consider:

- Extending the base SuperchainERC20 contract with additional functionality
- Implementing specific business logic through the owner interface
- Adding governance controls for managing permissions and parameters

### Converting Existing ERC20 Tokens

For projects with existing ERC20 tokens, migration to SuperchainERC20 requires:

1. Creating a new SuperchainERC20 implementation
2. Deploying it deterministically across all target chains
3. Setting up a migration mechanism for existing token holders
4. Configuring cross-chain permissions correctly

This process preserves token economics while enabling cross-chain functionality.

## Resources and Documentation

SuperchainERC20 enables token issuers to seamlessly access Superchain network effects. By leveraging SuperchainERC20 and Superchain interop, developers can focus on buildingfeatures rather than solving complex cross-chain challenges.
