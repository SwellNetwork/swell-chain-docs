## Deploying a Safe Multisig

### Prerequisites
- A wallet with a small amount of ETH on Swellchain for transaction fees
- The wallet addresses of all intended signers

### Deployment Steps

1. Navigate to [https://safe.optimism.io/](https://safe.optimism.io/) and connect your wallet.

2. Select the Swellchain network from the network dropdown. If Swellchain isn't listed, you can add it manually with the following parameters:

   | Parameter | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Chain Name | Swellchain |
   | Chain ID | 1923 |
   | RPC URL | https://swell-mainnet.alt.technology |
   | Block Explorer | https://swellchainscan.io |

3. Click "Create new Safe" to begin the deployment process.

4. Select the network where you want to deploy your Safe. You can deploy to multiple networks if needed.

5. Configure your Safe by adding signers:
   - Add the wallet addresses of all intended signers
   - Set the threshold (minimum number of signatures required to approve transactions)
   - The threshold should be between 1 and the total number of signers

6. Review your configuration and confirm the deployment.

   <Callout type="info">
   The deployment requires a small amount of ETH for transaction fees. This amount is typically minimal (approximately 0.000001 ETH).
   </Callout>

7. After deployment, you'll need to activate your Safe by funding it and signing an initial transaction.

## Using Your Safe Multisig

### Managing Funds

To send funds from your Safe:

1. Select "New Transaction" from the Safe interface.
2. Choose "Send tokens" as the transaction type.
3. Enter the recipient address and the amount to send.
4. Submit the transaction for approval.
5. Once the required number of signers (meeting your threshold) have approved, execute the transaction.

### Interacting with Smart Contracts

Your Safe can interact with any smart contract on Swellchain:

1. Select "New Transaction" from the Safe interface.
2. Choose "Contract interaction" as the transaction type.
3. Enter the contract address and ABI, or use the interface to select the function and parameters.
4. Submit the transaction for approval by the required signers.
5. Execute the approved transaction.

### Managing Signers

You can modify your Safe configuration after deployment:

1. Navigate to the "Settings" tab in your Safe interface.
2. Select "Owners" to add or remove signers.
3. Select "Policies" to modify the approval threshold.
4. Any changes to the configuration require approval from the current signers based on the existing threshold.

## Security Considerations

- The security of your Safe multisig depends on how you manage the signer keys. Each signer should follow best practices for key management.
- Consider using hardware wallets for signer accounts to maximize security.
- Test transactions with small amounts before moving significant assets.
- Regularly review your Safe's transaction history and settings to ensure they remain secure.
