## Introduction

In this guide, we will cover the following:
- How to setup your wallet/network
- How to bridge assets to Swell Chain
  - How to get testnet funds
- How to deploy a smart contract
- How to interact with your deployed contract

This will enable you to get a feel of the Swell Network L2 and start building on top of it.

## Network Configuration

To interact with Swell Chain, you need to add the following networks to your wallet:

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Tabs items={['Mainnet', 'Testnet']} groupId="network" persist>
  <Tab value="Mainnet">
    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Chain Name | Swell Network |
    | Chain ID | 1923 |
    | RPC URL | https://swell-mainnet.alt.technology |
    | Block Explorer | https://swell-mainnet-explorer.alt.technology |
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Testnet">
    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Chain Name | Swell Network Testnet |
    | Chain ID | 1924 |
    | RPC URL | https://swell-testnet.alt.technology |
    | Block Explorer | https://swell-testnet-explorer.alt.technology |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The networks can also be added through [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/?search=swell&testnets=true).

## Development Setup

### Obtaining Test ETH

1. Switch your wallet network to Swell Chain Testnet
2. Navigate to the [Swell Faucet](https://faucet.swellnetwork.io) {/* TODO: Add link*/}
3. Connect your wallet and request testnet ETH

### Asset Bridging

The [Swell Bridge](https://bridge.swellnetwork.io) enables asset transfers between Ethereum and Swell Chain:

```solidity
// Bridge Contract Addresses
interface IBridgeAddresses {
    // Mainnet
    address constant BRIDGE_MAINNET = 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010;
    address constant WETH_MAINNET = 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006;
    address constant USDT_MAINNET = 0x41a0bD84E65e75Bc30AFBbe6ea142eBBcc347542;

    // Testnet  
    address constant BRIDGE_TESTNET = 0xeBb79a1D00B2d489f53ADee985a2Ded2A3553F22;
    address constant USDT_TESTNET = 0xfd665f836095Ed02fDBF3C4F24174D70DFD6b69c;
}
```

## Smart Contract Development

Let's deploy your first contract on Swell Chain.
Use the following code as a template. 
It is a simple counter contract that can be incremented and decremented.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;

    // Function to get the current count
    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return count;
    }

    // Function to increment count by 1
    function inc() public {
        count += 1;
    }

    // Function to decrement count by 1
    function dec() public {
        // This function will fail if count = 0
        count -= 1;
    }
}
```

## Network Architecture

Swell Chain combines the Optimism Superchain with AltLayer's restaking infrastructure:

### Core Components

- **Optimism Superchain**: A unified network of OP Chains sharing bridging, governance, and communication layers
- **AltLayer AVSs**:
  - MACH: Provides accelerated finality
  - VITAL: Enables decentralized verification
  - SQUAD: Powers decentralized sequencing

These services leverage Ethereum's security through EigenLayer's restaking mechanism.

## Transaction Fees

Swell Chain transactions include two components:

1. **L2 Execution Fee**: Cost for transaction execution on L2
2. **L1 Security Fee**: Estimated cost for L1 publication

Fee optimization strategies:
- Submit transactions during low L1 gas periods (weekends)
- Monitor L2 congestion for optimal execution timing
