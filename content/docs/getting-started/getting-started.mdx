import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

## Introduction

In this guide, we will cover the following:
1. Setting up your wallet and network configuration
2. Bridging assets between Ethereum and Swell Chain
3. Obtaining testnet funds for development
4. Deploying smart contracts to the network
5. Interacting with deployed contracts

This will enable you to get a feel of the Swell Chain and start building on top of it.

## Network Configuration

To interact with Swell Chain, you need to add the following networks to your wallet:

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Tabs items={['Mainnet', 'Testnet']} groupId="network" persist>
  <Tab value="Mainnet">
    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Chain Name | Swell Chain |
    | Chain ID | 1923 |
    | RPC URL | https://swell-mainnet.alt.technology |
    | Block Explorer | https://swell-mainnet-explorer.alt.technology |
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Testnet">
    | Parameter | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Chain Name | Swell Chain Testnet |
    | Chain ID | 1924 |
    | RPC URL | https://swell-testnet.alt.technology |
    | Block Explorer | https://swell-testnet-explorer.alt.technology |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The networks can also be added through [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/?search=swell&testnets=true).

## Development Setup

### Obtaining Test ETH

1. Switch your wallet network to Swell Chain Testnet
2. Navigate to the [Swell Faucet](https://faucet.swellnetwork.io) {/* TODO: Add link*/}
3. Connect your wallet and request testnet ETH

### Asset Bridging

The [Swell Bridge](https://bridge.swellnetwork.io) enables asset transfers between Ethereum and Swell Chain:

```solidity
// Bridge Contract Addresses
interface IBridgeAddresses {
    // Mainnet
    address constant BRIDGE_MAINNET = 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010;
    address constant WETH_MAINNET = 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006;
    address constant USDT_MAINNET = 0x41a0bD84E65e75Bc30AFBbe6ea142eBBcc347542;

    // Testnet  
    address constant BRIDGE_TESTNET = 0xeBb79a1D00B2d489f53ADee985a2Ded2A3553F22;
    address constant USDT_TESTNET = 0xfd665f836095Ed02fDBF3C4F24174D70DFD6b69c;
}
```

### Bridging ERC20 Tokens

The Standard Bridge contract enables asset transfers between Ethereum and Swell Chain through a lock-and-mint mechanism. 

To bridge assets, call the `bridgeERC20To()` function on the bridge contract with the following parameters: 
<TypeTable
  type={{
    sourceToken: {
      description: 'The address of the token to bridge on the source chain',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    },
    destinationToken: {
      description: 'The address of the token to mint on the destination chain',
      type: 'address', 
      default: '-'
    },
    recipient: {
      description: 'The address to receive the bridged tokens',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    },
    amount: {
      description: 'The amount of tokens to bridge',
      type: 'uint256',
      default: '-'
    },
    gasLimit: {
      description: 'Minimum gas limit for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'uint256',
      default: '-'
    },
    extraData: {
      description: 'Optional additional data for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'bytes',
      default: '0x'
    }
  }}
/>

### Bridging ETH

To bridge ETH between Ethereum and Swell Chain, call the `bridgeETH()` or `bridgeETHTo()` functions on the bridge contract:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    recipient: {
      description: 'The address to receive the bridged ETH (only for bridgeETHTo)',
      type: 'address',
      default: '-'
    },
    gasLimit: {
      description: 'Minimum gas limit for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'uint256',
      default: '-'
    },
    extraData: {
      description: 'Optional additional data for the bridge transaction',
      type: 'bytes',
      default: '0x'
    }
  }}
/>

<Callout type="info">
You can also bridge by sending a basic ETH transfer from an EOA directly to the Bridge Contract address.
This is possible because the Bridge Contract includes a receive function that enables direct ETH transfers from an EOA on Ethereum to Swell Chain without calling specific bridge functions.
Find the contract addresses for mainnet and testnet in the [Contract Addresses](/docs/developer-resources/contract-addresses) section.
</Callout>



### Bridge Mechanics

The bridge locks the tokens on the source chain and mints equivalent tokens on the destination chain. 
Transfers from Ethereum to Swell Chain complete in 1-3 minutes, while transfers back to Ethereum have a 7-day challenge period.


For more information on bridging assets via the Standard Bridge Contract, refer to the [Standard Bridge documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/standard-bridge).

## Smart Contract Development

Let's deploy your first contract on Swell Chain.
Use the following code as a template. 
It is a simple counter contract that can be incremented and decremented.

```solidity title="Counter.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;

    // Function to get the current count
    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return count;
    }

    // Function to increment count by 1
    function inc() public {
        count += 1;
    }

    // Function to decrement count by 1
    function dec() public {
        // This function will fail if count = 0
        count -= 1;
    }
}
```

## Network Architecture

Swell Chain combines the Optimism Superchain with AltLayer's restaking infrastructure:

### Core Components

- **Optimism Superchain**: A unified network of OP Chains sharing bridging, governance, and communication layers
- **AltLayer AVSs**:
  - MACH: Provides accelerated finality
  - VITAL: Enables decentralized verification
  - SQUAD: Powers decentralized sequencing

These services leverage Ethereum's security through EigenLayer's restaking mechanism.

## Transaction Fees

Swell Chain transactions include two components:

1. **L2 Execution Fee**: Cost for transaction execution on L2
2. **L1 Security Fee**: Estimated cost for L1 publication

Fee optimization strategies:
- Submit transactions during low L1 gas periods (weekends)
- Monitor L2 congestion for optimal execution timing
