# Swellchain

> Swellchain is a restaking-powered Layer 2 network built on the OP Stack that extends Ethereum's security through EigenLayer's restaking mechanism while leveraging Optimism's proven infrastructure for scalability.

Swellchain documentation provides comprehensive resources for developers, validators, and users to understand and interact with the Swellchain ecosystem.
